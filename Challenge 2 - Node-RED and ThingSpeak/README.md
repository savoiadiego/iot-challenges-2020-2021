# Challenge 2 - Node-RED and ThingSpeak
In this second challenge, I had to develop a Node-RED application capable of reading some network traffic messages from the "traffic.csv" file,
keeping only the MQTT publish messages related to some specific topics, and sending the "value" field of those messages to a [ThingSpeak channel](https://thingspeak.com/channels/1358319)
in order to display them in charts.
