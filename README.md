# IoT Challenges 2020/2021
Home challenges done during the "Internet of Things" course 2020/2021.\
Developed by Diego Savoia.

Each one of the four challenges involves different softwares used in the IoT world.\
Inside each folder there is a PDF file containing the description of the challenge, another PDF file containing a report explaining the solution I developed, and possibly the given data and the code I produced.\
There is also a unique README in each folder, summarizing the challenges.
