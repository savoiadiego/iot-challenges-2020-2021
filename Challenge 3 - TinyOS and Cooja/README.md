# Challenge 3 - TinyOS and Cooja
In this third challenge, I had to create a Cooja simulation with three TinyOS motes, which are sending messages in broadcast with some specified fixed frequency.
These messages are then used by the other motes to turn on/off their LEDs, according to some specified rules.
